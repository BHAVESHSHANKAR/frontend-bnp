# API Configuration for Local Development
VITE_API=http://localhost:5000
VITE_ML_API=http://localhost:8000

# For production deployment (these are automatically handled by apiConfig.js):
# Express Backend: https://bnp-backend.vercel.app
# ML Backend: https://ml-bnp-backend.onrender.com

# Note: The frontend automatically detects production environment and uses deployed URLs
# You only need to set these environment variables for local development overrides
